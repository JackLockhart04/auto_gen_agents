# Tool Building Team

This could end up being kind of a large project
Want to add making files, writing to files, changing files, searching internet, and so on to ensure full autonomous capabilities when creating tools
Also will end up using multiple agents in a workflow to ensure planning, development, and testing are all taken care of

## Tool goals

- Web searching
- File managing (Create, delete, move) with verification from user
- File changing (Writing to files including deleting stuff)
- Change management (Similar to how vscode and cursors agents show changes and allow accepting it)
